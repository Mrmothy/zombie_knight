### About the game making experience:

This was my biggest project I have made in Pygame so far. This game used everything I have learned
and more. I really got to use my understanding of Python classes and how Pygame works as a whole.
I learned how to use Tile maps and sprites with animation to bring level design and life to my 
player and enemies. I learned how to use and create vectors and Kinematic movement to make my player
movement flow smoothly. I also learned how to create player and object masks to make collision 
detection a lot more precise between my player and enemies and my tile map. There is still a lot to 
learn and understand about game development and Pygame altogether but this game was an awesome start.

### Image, Music and Design Shout-outs:

The game loop design was used from a UDEMY corse lead by Michael Eramo. This gme design is based
off a game he created call Zombie Knight and can be found in his corse call:
The Art of Doing: Video Game Creation With Python and Pygame
